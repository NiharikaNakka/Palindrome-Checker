The Palindrome Checker project is a simple web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to input a string and check if it is a palindrome, a word or phrase that reads the same backward as forward. The HTML structure provides the input field and a button to submit the string. CSS is used to style the interface, making it user-friendly and visually appealing. JavaScript handles the logic by processing the input, removing non-alphanumeric characters, and comparing the string with its reverse to determine if it's a palindrome, displaying the result dynamically on the webpage.# Palindrome-Checker
